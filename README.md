# Love Running Project

This is a walkthorugh project completed through the [Code Institute](http://codeinstitute.net) Web Development Course. It is not a real running club, no matter how enticing it looks

As the project itself was a walkthrough I have to credit the HTML and CSS code to the Code Institute, although the project was a good way to see how the structure of HTML and styling of CSS came together. 

My personal reason for making a repo and uploading the material (originally done in replit) is to practice:
* File and project structures - making sure I can put things in the correct place and links all work. 
* Use VS Code as an editor, so I can work offline to a degree and also to try and increase knowledge of how Git works. 
* Use Git to commit files to the repo - as a practice following walk throughs from coursework. 
* Start to use GitHub as a remote storage of work and projects on my coding journey. 
* Start to use Markdown to write README.md files - this is just the beginning!

Whilst I cannot commit to following through on these with time tight and deadlines with projects to make, I may use this project as a place to experiment in the future also, adding extra content beyond the basic pages that are there currently. 
* Create a blog type section where people can recommend runs and commetn on others
* Create a dummy sign in / sign up  feature
* Create training plans / tracking apps (I imagine I need JS and SQL knowledge before thinking about this though, as with passwords!)

At the time of the initial commit, the technologies used are:
* HTML 5
* CSS
* Although not a technology, respoinsive design of these elements is also included.
